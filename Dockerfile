# ============================================================================
# This image provides what's needed to build .NET projects with Buildvana SDK
# in GitLab CI, including Windows setup program generation via InnoSetup:
#
#   - .NET SDK
#   - Wine (to run command-line InnoSetup)
#   - XVFB (for running Wine without a display)
#   - GitLab's release-cli
#
# TODO: Try to make the image smaller (not trivial: Wine requires X11
#       or Wayland, even for running conaole programs!)
#       Things we may try:
#         - Switch from Ubuntu to Alpine Linux (X11?? Wine??)
#         - Remove some unused packages (which ones?)
#         - Take inspiration from other projects, namely:
#             * https://github.com/suchja/x11client
#             * https://github.com/amake/wine
#             * https://github.com/amake/innosetup-docker
#           (.NET SDK will have to be added via Dockerfile, though)
